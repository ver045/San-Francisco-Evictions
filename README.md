# San-Francisco-Evictions
Explored correlation between eviction rates and the tech industry from 2009-2019 as the tech industry grew in San Francisco.

## Initial Assumptions
San Francisco eviction rates are on the rise.

People being kicked out of their home is a significant contributor to our homeless crisis

Laws and regulations meant to protect tenant rights have loopholes that are actually being utilized against tenants, resulting in evictions

## Project Summary
We were discussing homelessness and wondering if evictions are one of the primary contributors to people ending up on the street. That morphed into a general 

conversation about this assumption that SF evictions are on the rise. 

In researching SF eviction data, we noticed that while there are many reasons why a landlord may send someone an eviction notice, all the reasons fall into 2

buckets: Fault of the tenant, and no-fault of the tenant.

San Francisco’s data shows that it's less than 2%.

To put that in perspective, that’s less than two-thirds of the state average

That’s 1.2 evictions/day


## Starting Hypothesis

While SF eviction rates are lower than expected, we’re curious to look at how neighborhood rates are influenced by tech companies moving in.

We assume that neighborhoods that have had a huge influx of tech companies have probably seen a spike in eviction rates as landlords try to cash in

### Questions to answer:

Have the yr-over-yr eviction rates increased or decreased since 2010?

What are the leading reasons for evictions?

Which neighborhoods have the highest/lowest eviction rates?

Have big tech companies impacted these rates?

## Our Process

Brainstorm hypothesis

Prioritize starting with the cleanest dataset possible, if not, clean data

Determined the goals of our project and what we wanted to learn

Drew out graphs needed to identify trends in our data

Cleaned data in Jupyter Notebook, created graphs

Analyzed the data and notice trends, new findings, etc
